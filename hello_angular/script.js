/*
 * AngularJS uses functions to abstract a framework. Just like an
 * object-oriented framework often uses abstract functions to define
 * placeholders for functions defined by derived classes, AngularJS (and
 * other JavaScript packages) use higher-level functions, for example,
 * functions taking functions as arguments, as a placeholder. I, the
 * consumer of the framework/package/module, define a function to do the
 * work needed by my application. I then pass that function as an
 * argument to a framework function.

	// Notice that the framework function invokes the application
	// function in the midst of doing other work. In this case, it
	// simply logs the fact that it is starting work and when work ends.
	// Additionally, it wraps the supplied function in a `try-catch`
	// block, perhaps to provide a common mechanism to handle errors.

/*
 * Finally, at some later time, the framework invokes its function (in
 * this example, `doWork`). This invocation performs the work of the
 * framework *in addition to* the application work performed by `work`.
