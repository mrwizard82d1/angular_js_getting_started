	 Scott Allen put the ng-app directive on the html tag. I'm uncertain why other than to ensure it encloses the entire
	 page. 

	 In particular, I wonder if it is required in order to have the directive affect the scripts that are loaded. I do
	 not think so, but I just do not know. :(

	 I place the `ng-controller` attribute on the `body` tag. This placement enables the controller, `MainController`,
	 to control all child tags; that is, all elements within the body of the page.

	This code results in an error because AngularJS cannot find a function named `MainController`. (I've not yet written
	it. :) ) 

	Once I write the function, AngularJS, when the page is rendered, will execute this function to "control" the scope
	(model) of AngularJS binding exrpessions (an expression in double curly braces `{{}}`).
