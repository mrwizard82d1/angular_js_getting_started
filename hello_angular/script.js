// Code goes here

/*
 * Although the following code work, it does not scale well. The problem
 * is that each of the names, `createWorker` and `worker` are
 * **global**. In our current situation, having these two variables in
 * the global namespace causes no problems. 
 *
 * Now imagine a situation in which this script is part of many
 * different scripts bundled together on a page. Unfortunately, naming a
 * variable, `worker` and naming a function, `createWorker` is
 * **common**. Many of our team members have similar names in our code. 
 *
 * When we attempt to run this code together with our co-workers, we now
 * have a problem. When the JavaScript interpreter encounters the name,
 * `worker`, which value is it it bound to? If my teammates script
 * changed the value to which `worker` is bound **before** I evaluate
 * the expression `worker.job1()`, what will happen? We just do not
 * know. :()
 */

/*
 * This script is an example of the "revealing module pattern."
 *
 * In this pattern, one **does not** write functions inline; instead,
 * one writes functions that return objects (the "module") containing
 * the functions exposed by the modules.

 * The function, `createWorker`, is a function returning an object (a
 * module) that contains the behavior exposed by our API.
